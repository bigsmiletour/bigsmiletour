Where is Mount Rinjani?
  </h1>
  </center>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
Mount Rinjani is located on the island of Lombok in Indonesia. Lombok is situated in South East Asia, and forms part of the Lesser Sunda Isles. Mount Rinjani’s geographical co-ordinates are 8°24′52″S 116°27′35″E. Technically Mt Rinjani is in North Lombok (it falls under the administration of the Regency of North Lombok), but the slopes of Gunung Rinjani National Park span to North, East, West and Central Lombok – the mountain very much dominates the island.

    <h1 style="font-size: 35px">
What type of volcano is Mount Rinjani?
    </h1>
  </center>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>Mount Rinjani a stratovolcano, a volcano built-up of alternate layers of lava and ash. Stratovolcanoes are typically found along subduction zones (areas where one tectonic plate is pushed beneath another tectonic plate into the Earth’s Mantle). Mount Rinjani is also classed as a somma volcano, “a volcanic caldera that has been partially filled by a new central cone” (in this case the active Mt Barujari).

 <h1 style="font-size:35px">
How was Mount Rinjani formed?
 </h1>
</center>
<br>
<br>
<p>
The volcanic activity that formed Mount Rinjani is due to the subduction of the Indo-Australian oceanic crust beneath the Lesser Sunda Islands (an archipelago of which Lombok is part). In its current form, Mt Rinjani and its large crater lake are thought to have formed when Mt Samalas erupted in 1257. This eruption was colossal in scale, and is believed to have contributed to a period of global cooling and mini ice age. Mt Barujari (which sits in the crater lake, Segara Anak) is the active part of this historic volcanic system. It is believed by geologists that Mt Samalas stood next to Mt Rinjani. If you imagine the slopes that lead up to the caldera continuing to a summit, you can speculate as to where Samalas stood, and how high. It is believed that pressure in a magma chamber beneath Samalas rose to such a point that it started cracking the rock above it. When the magma broke out of Samalas the chamber below it partially emptied. With nothing to support the great weight of Mt Samalas above, the mountain collapsed in on itself. At its peak the eruption of Samalas blasted out over one million tonnes of material a second. During the ultimate collapse of the mountain, six cubic miles of ash and volcanic rock formed giant pyroclastic flows that raced down towards the coast at speeds of over 125 miles per hour. An immense volcanic cloud started to envelop the whole world. This was a cataclysmic event that is thought to be greater in magnitude than the eruption of Krakatoa.

    When did Mount Rinjani last erupt?
  </h1>
</center>
<br>
<br>
<p>
Mount Rinjani last erupted on 27th September 2016. A small-scale eruption of Mt Barujari (which sits in Lake Segara Anak) produced a plume of ash that rose 2km above the crater, disrupting air travel in the region. No one was killed or injured as a result of the eruption.

Is Mount Rinjani dangerous?
  </h1>
</center>
<br>
<br>
<p>
  Compared to many mountains around the world, Mt Rinjani is fairly safe to climb. It is not a technical mountain, with the paths well established and easy to follow. Although there are some steep sections where you should exercise caution, the use of ropes is not necessary. The main routes are trekked by thousands of tourists a year, many of whom are not experienced mountaineers. Volcanically Mt Rinjani is active, but the active component (Mt Barujari) lies in the lake, away from the trail. If agencies detect signs of increased volcanic activity that may result in an eruption, they take the precautionary measure of closing the National Park. Lombok is susceptible to earthquakes, which can result in rocks getting dislodged and landslides occurring. When this occurred in 2018 the mountain was evacuated successfully and the park temporarily closed. Fatalities are not completely unheard of, but thankfully they are very rare. The most prominent case of people losing their lives on the mountain was in 2007, when 7 students died from exposure. The university students had embarked on the ill-fated expedition despite all trekking routes in the national park being closed due to inclement weather. For this and other reasons, Rinjani Dawn Adventures always follows the rules of TNGR, the national park authority.

<br>
<p>
For a complete packing-list and further information about climbing Mount Rinjani, please refer to our official <B>Mount Rinjani Trekking Guide,</B>which is updated frequently and serves as the most comprehensive resource for people wanting to summit Rinjani. In short, Lombok is situated in the tropics, so daytime temperatures are usually warm. T-shirt, shorts and trekking shoes are recommended for daytime walking. At night-time temperatures can drop significantly, so warm layers, trousers and a jacket are necessary. Going to the summit in the early morning can be particularly cold, especially if it is windy. In addition to the warm clothes already mentioned, hat and gloves are highly recommended. Being in the tropics there is also the chance of heavy rain. Rain can either be a quick shower or a prolonged torrent. For that reason, it’s worth taking a rain jacket or poncho. Please refer to our frequently asked questions for more in-depth advice about clothing and equipment.
